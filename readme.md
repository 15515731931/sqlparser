##Notice

The backbone of this repo is extracted from [youtube/vitess](https://github.com/youtube/vitess).

Inside youtube/vitess there is a very nicely written sql parser. However as it's not a self-contained application, I created this one. 
It applies the same LICENSE as youtube/vitess.

##What's More In this REPO

* Rewrite SQL Queries by self-defined rewriter
* Able to parse Create Table statements way much better
