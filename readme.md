##Notice

The backbone of this repo is extracted from [youtube/vitess](https://github.com/youtube/vitess).

Inside youtube/vitess there is a very nicely written sql parser, but it's not a self-contained application. Thus I created this one. Also it applies the same LICENSE as youtube/vitess.

##What's More In this REPO

Rewrite SQL Queries by self-defined rewriter

##What's Next

Schema parsing
